Girls, you know
When you're in the mood
You may meet a man
Can't do anything good
But, you gotta pity him
And try to understand
That a hero, a hero is so hard to find
When he takes you
For his love
And he tries to tell you
There isn't any other
Oh, he may kiss you
And tell you he'll miss you
But don't forget, a hero is so hard to find
When he says hello
Don't forget they're all the same
You may end up sitting all alone
And with yourself to blame
Oh, ? know your love?
So, when he tells you
You got diamonds in your eyes
Don't get carried away
'Cause you know he's selling you lies
So when you get the feeling
The man you've got's no good
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find
Well, just remember, a hero is so hard to find
