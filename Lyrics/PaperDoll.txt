You like a man with a future
You like a woman with a past
Well, do you really believe that?
She said to the faces in the crowd
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
And even if you did miss me
You never let me know
You'd prefer to be just a little bit
In and out of love with me
And not to scream and shout
You'd prefer to be just a little bit in and out of agony
Fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
Come on now, let the sad winds blow down
As the rain came, she refused to wear her coat
But deep in her heart she knew
That the song must go on
He says, "Well, I have forgotten you
And your beautiful eyes
We were off the wall
We were mirrors of our former selves"
Well, you could have said no
You could have said, well I just can't
Whoa, we were off the wall
We were mirrors of each other passing by
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
Well, I was your paper doll (yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Paper doll
Well, I was youR paper doll (yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)
Paper doll
And it doesn't even matter (I was fascinated by somebody else)
It was a real clear answer
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
