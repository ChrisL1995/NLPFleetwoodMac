I love the purple dancer
Dancing in the space of, time
She can surely know the answer
Standing in the steps of, mine
Will I leave her?
Will I wonder?
Will I fall down to the ground?
Is it love that is the answer?
Will she lift me to the sound?
Must I stay a minute longer?
Eyes bewitching me does more
Tries to keep me from my wonder
Knowing her though, I must go
Will I leave or
Will I wonder?
Will I fall down to the ground?
Is it love that is the answer?
Will she lift me to the sound?
I love the purple dancer
Dancing in the space of, time
She can surely know the answer
Standing in the steps of, mine
Will I leave her?
Will I wonder?
Will I fall down to the ground?
Is it love that is the answer?
Will she lift me to the sound?
Will I leaver or
Will I wonder?
Will I fall down to the ground?
Is it love that is the answer?
Will she lift me to the sound?
