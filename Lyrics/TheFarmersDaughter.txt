I do come from miles away
Ain't got no place to stay
Glad to help you plow your fields
Farmer's daughter
Might be just a couple of days
Clean up, rest, and be on my way
Thank you, madam, much obliged
Farmer's daughter
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So long, got to leave your land
Many thanks, it was mighty grand
I do hope to see you again
Farmer's daughter
Oh, oh, farmer's daughter
Ooh, ooh, farmer's daughter
Ooh, ooh, farmer's daughter
Ooh, ooh, farmer's daughter
