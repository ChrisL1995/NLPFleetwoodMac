Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh, I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill
Lookin' out for love
Big, big love
You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill
Lookin' out for love
Big, big love
I wake up
Alone with it all
I wake up
But only to fall
Lookin' out for love
Big, big love
Just lookin' out for love
Big, big love
