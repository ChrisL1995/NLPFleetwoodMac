You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
14 joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very
Sentimental, gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady
Gentle one
Sentimental, gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady
Gentle one
Now you are here today
But easily you might just go away
Because we live in a time
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
14 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental, gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady
Gentle one
Sentimental, gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady
Gentle one
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are
Yes
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
14 joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very
Sentimental, gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady
Gentle one
Sentimental, gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady
Gentle one
Sentimental, gentle wind (all of the things that I said that I wanted)
Blowing through my life again (come rushing by in my head when I'm with you)
Sentimental lady (14 joys and a will to be merry)
Gentle one (all of the things)
Sentimental, gentle wind (all of the things that I said that I wanted)
Blowing through my life again (come rushing by in my head when I'm with you)
Sentimental lady (14 joys and a will to be merry)
Gentle one (all of the things that we say are very)
Sentimental, gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady
