I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town
I'm a looking for a sweet woman, make my love come down
If she a married woman
She only nine years old
If she a married woman, yeah
Only nine years old
I got a woman I'm loving, keep me fishin' all day long
I'm thinking Self lane once in the countryside
I'm thinking Self lane once in the countryside
I'll take in Self lane once in the countryside
And I'm leaving this morning, won't be back no more
Yeah, I'm leaving this morning, won't be back no more
There ain't a rider in the city, keep me inside the door
